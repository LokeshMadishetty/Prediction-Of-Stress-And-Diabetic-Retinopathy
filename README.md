Title of the project: Prediction Of Stress And Diabetic Retinopathy Using Touch Screen Data

Description of Project: The growing use of digital gadgets has detrimental effects on both physical and mental well-being. Prolonged and consistent exposure may heighten stress levels, provoke anxiety, and disrupt sleep patterns, ultimately resulting in obesity, cardiovascular ailments, hypertension, impaired stress control, reduced levels of HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance.​ Psychological consequences include suicide ideation, depressive symptoms, impaired sleep, and negativity impacted by content. Relying on digital devices may lead to heightened arousal, elevated levels of stress hormones, and impede mental vitality and growt​h This work used machine learning algorithms to forecast the occurrence of diabetes associated with stress in individuals who use touch screens. In this work, three models, namely RF (Random Forest), LR (Logistic Regression), and XG Boosting, were evaluated. ​ The algorithms were trained using two datasets, which included measurements of glucose, insulin, blood pressure, BMI, stress, and age. The algorithms' accuracy was evaluated using performance measures. Users may retrieve the information to anticipate stress and diabetes by using touch-screen devices.​
